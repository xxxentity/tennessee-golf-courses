MAP ACCURACY FIX PROCESS - SUCCESSFUL METHOD
==================================================

PROBLEM: Golf course coordinates were inaccurate, showing courses "streets away" from actual locations

SOLUTION: ArcGIS World Geocoder (Proven Most Accurate)

WINNING METHOD:
1. Use ArcGIS World Geocoding Service: https://geocode.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer/findAddressCandidates
2. Parameters: SingleLine=address, f=json, countryCode=USA, maxLocations=1
3. Look for confidence scores 80+ (90-100% is ideal)
4. Extract coordinates: [location.x, location.y] format
5. Update 3 places: course page address, Google Maps embed, interactive map coordinates

COURSES FIXED WITH THIS METHOD:
- Southern Hills Golf & Country Club: [-85.599524, 36.104977] (was way off)
- Chattanooga Golf & Country Club: [-85.280602, 35.068222] (ArcGIS verified)
- Nashville Golf & Athletic Club: [-86.786604, 35.962086] (corrected address too)
- The Golf Club of Tennessee: [-87.090523, 36.068202] (corrected address)
- Greystone Golf Course: [-87.421305, 36.086740] (corrected address)
- Montgomery Bell State Park: [-87.261547, 36.090637] (corrected address)
- Colonial Country Club: [-89.778759, 35.196525] (maximum precision)
- All 29 courses from systematic fix batch

ADDRESS CORRECTIONS MADE:
- Nashville Golf & Athletic Club: 1703 Crockett Springs Trail, Brentwood, TN 37027
- The Golf Club of Tennessee: 1000 Golf Club Dr, Kingston Springs, TN 37082
- Greystone Golf Course: 2555 US-70, Dickson, TN 37055
- Montgomery Bell State Park: 800 Hotel Ave, Burns, TN 37029

SUCCESS RATE: ~95% accuracy with ArcGIS
CONFIDENCE SCORES: 84-100% for all successful geocodes

ALTERNATIVE METHODS TESTED (Less accurate):
- OpenStreetMap Nominatim: Good backup, ~80% accuracy
- Google Maps API: Requires API key, access issues
- Other services: Lower accuracy rates

FOR FUTURE COORDINATE FIXES:
1. Use fix_course_coordinates.py template
2. Always verify with ArcGIS World Geocoder
3. Update all 3 locations: course page, Google embed, interactive map
4. Commit with descriptive message including confidence score

TOTAL COURSES FIXED: 35+ courses with precise GPS coordinates

ALTERNATIVE METHOD: NAMECHEAP FILE MANAGER
==========================================
If you prefer not to use FTP software:

1. Log into Namecheap
2. Go to your hosting dashboard
3. Find "File Manager" 
4. Navigate to public_html folder
5. Click "Upload" and select your files
6. Upload index.html, styles.css, script.js

IMPORTANT FILE STRUCTURE:
=========================
Your public_html folder should look like this:
public_html/
├── index.html (your homepage)
├── styles.css (your styling)
├── script.js (your JavaScript)
├── images/ (folder for logos/photos)
└── any other files

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
- If site doesn't load: Check that index.html is in public_html (not a subfolder)
- If styles don't work: Make sure styles.css is in the same folder as index.html
- If you get 404 errors: Check file names are exact (case-sensitive)
- If FTP won't connect: Try using your server's IP address instead of domain name

NEXT STEPS AFTER UPLOAD:
=========================
1. Test website on mobile and desktop
2. Check all links work
3. Verify contact forms work
4. Test search functionality
5. Set up Google Analytics tracking
6. Submit to search engines

UPDATING YOUR WEBSITE:
======================
1. Make changes to your local files
2. Upload the changed files via FTP
3. Clear your browser cache to see changes
4. Test to make sure everything still works

BACKUP STRATEGY:
================
1. Always keep local copies of your files
2. Consider downloading your live site files as backup
3. Save database backups if you add dynamic content later

SECURITY TIPS:
==============
1. Use strong passwords for FTP
2. Enable two-factor authentication on Namecheap
3. Keep local file backups
4. Monitor your site for unusual activity

DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SETUP:
======================
For your multiple domains:
- tennesseegolfcourses.com (main site)
- chattanoogagolfcourses.com (subdomain or redirect)
- knoxvillegolfcourses.com (subdomain or redirect)
- nashvillegolfcourses.com (subdomain or redirect)

You can either:
1. Create separate folders for each domain
2. Use redirects to point all domains to main site
3. Create subdomains that show city-specific content

RECOMMENDED FIRST UPLOAD:
=========================
Start with just these files:
1. index.html
2. styles.css  
3. script.js

Once these work, add:
1. Logo images
2. Course photos
3. Additional pages

This gets your site live quickly and you can build from there!

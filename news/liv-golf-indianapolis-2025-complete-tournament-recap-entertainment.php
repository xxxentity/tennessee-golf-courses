                    <p>Sebastian Munoz's journey from historic opening round to playoff victory provided one of the most compelling individual stories in LIV Golf history. The Colombian's first-round 59 immediately established him as the player to beat, but his ability to handle the pressure over three rounds and deliver in the clutch moments showcased the mental fortitude of a champion.</p>
                    
                    <p>The playoff victory was particularly sweet for Munoz, who had to dig deep after seeing his overnight lead evaporate under Rahm's spectacular final-round charge. His back-to-back birdies on 17 and 18 to force the playoff demonstrated remarkable composure, while his playoff birdie on 18 capped one of the most impressive tournament performances in LIV Golf's short but dramatic history.</p>
                    
                    <p>Munoz's $4 million winner's prize represents the largest payday of his professional career and validates his decision to join LIV Golf. More importantly, the victory positions him as one of the league's rising stars and provides momentum heading into the Team Championship finale.</p>

                    <h2>Rahm's Championship Defense</h2>
                    
                    <p>Jon Rahm's second consecutive Individual Championship defense provided one of the most dramatic storylines of the 2025 LIV Golf season. Despite not winning a single tournament during the regular season, Rahm's remarkable consistency and clutch performances when it mattered most earned him the season-long title and its $18 million first prize.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Spaniard's final-round 60 at Indianapolis was nothing short of spectacular, featuring 11 birdies in a round that showcased his exceptional talent under pressure. While he ultimately fell short in the playoff, his performance over the final 18 holes was enough to edge Joaquin Niemann by less than three points in the season-long standings.</p>
                    
                    <p>Rahm's ability to maintain his composure throughout a season that saw multiple players win multiple times demonstrates the kind of mental toughness that separates champions from contenders. His Individual Championship defense validates his status as one of LIV Golf's premier players and sets up an intriguing 2026 campaign.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Torque GC's Record-Breaking Team Victory</h2>
                    
                    <p>Sebastian Munoz's individual success was matched by Torque GC's dominant team performance, which resulted in a record-breaking victory and the team's first triumph since the 2023 season. The team's combined score of 64-under par set a new LIV Golf record and represented the end of a 28-event winless streak that had frustrated the squad.</p>
                    
                    <p>Torque GC's 10-shot victory over Jon Rahm's Legion XIII team demonstrated the importance of depth and consistency in LIV Golf's unique team format. The victory earned each of the four team members $750,000 from the team prize pool, adding to Munoz's individual winnings for a truly memorable week.</p>
                    
                    <p>The team championship also provided crucial momentum heading into next week's season-ending Team Championship in Michigan, where Torque GC will enter as one of the favorites to claim the ultimate team prize.</p>

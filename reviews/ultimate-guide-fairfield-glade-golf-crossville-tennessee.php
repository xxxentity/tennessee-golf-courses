        <section class="article-content">
            <p>Nestled on the pristine Cumberland Plateau in Crossville, Tennessee, Fairfield Glade stands as one of the South's most celebrated golf destinations. Known as the "Golf Capital of Tennessee," this remarkable 12,500-acre resort community offers five championship golf courses with a combined 90 holes of world-class golf. From Joe Lee's masterful Stonehenge to the historic Druid Hills, each course presents unique challenges while showcasing the natural beauty of Tennessee's mountain landscape.</p>

            <p>Located just five miles from Interstate 40 and positioned perfectly between Nashville (100 miles east) and Knoxville (70 miles west), Fairfield Glade has earned recognition from Golf Channel's Travel Segment as a Top 10 "Buddy Trip" destination. The resort's elevation of 2,000 feet provides not only stunning mountain vistas but also ideal playing conditions that make golf enjoyable year-round.</p>

            <h2>The Championship Courses of Fairfield Glade</h2>

            <p>Fairfield Glade's five championship courses represent the work of golf's most respected architects, including Jack Nicklaus, Joe Lee, Ron Garl, Bobby Greenwood, and Gary Roger Baird. These legendary designers have masterfully utilized the natural terrain and scenic beauty of the Cumberland Plateau to create challenging and memorable golf experiences that cater to players of all skill levels.</p>

                <p>Widely regarded as the crown jewel of Fairfield Glade's golf collection, <a href="/courses/stonehenge-golf-club" style="color: #22c55e;">Stonehenge Golf Club</a> has earned numerous accolades including being ranked #2 in Golfweek Magazine's "Best Courses You Can Play in Tennessee" and named among the top 5 courses in the state by Golf Week Magazine. This Joe Lee design, completed in 1984, showcases the legendary architect's ability to seamlessly integrate challenging golf with natural beauty.</p>

                <p>The course derives its name from the walls of native stone found throughout the 6,549-yard, par 72 layout. Natural rock outcroppings come dramatically into play on several holes, most notably on the signature downhill par 3 14th hole, where a 15-foot layered stone retaining wall runs along the left and rear of the green, creating one of Tennessee's most photographed golf holes.</p>

                <p>Joe Lee, who built more than 200 courses worldwide before his passing in 2003, was known for his philosophy that courses should "make golfers smile." Jack Nicklaus paid Lee the ultimate compliment, stating that he "never built a bad course," and Stonehenge stands as a testament to this legacy. The course features pristine bentgrass greens, strategic bunkering, and elevation changes that provide breathtaking views of the surrounding Cumberland Mountains.</p>

                <p><a href="/courses/druid-hills-golf-club" style="color: #22c55e;">Druid Hills Golf Club</a> holds the distinction of being the first golf course at Fairfield Glade, with the initial nine holes opening for play in 1970 and the full 18-hole championship layout completed in 1973. Designed by Leon Howard, this historic course is situated on the highest point in Fairfield Glade, providing spectacular panoramic views of the surrounding mountains that inspired its Celtic name.</p>

                <p>The course features rolling, tree-lined fairways that wind through the natural contours of the mountainous terrain. Multiple water hazards, strategic doglegs, and undulating bentgrass greens create a true test of golf that has challenged players for over four decades. The elevated position of Druid Hills not only provides scenic beauty but also creates unique playing conditions, with the mountain air affecting ball flight and club selection.</p>

                <p>What sets Druid Hills apart is its combination of historical significance and natural beauty. As the original course that established Fairfield Glade as a golf destination, it represents the foundation upon which Tennessee's Golf Capital was built. The mature landscaping and established tree lines create a parkland-style experience that contrasts beautifully with the more modern designs found elsewhere in the resort.</p>

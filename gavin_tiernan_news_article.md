## ETSU Golfer Gavin Tiernan Finishes Runner-Up at Prestigious Amateur Championship

**Johnson City, TN** - East Tennessee State University men's golfer Gavin Tiernan capped off a remarkable tournament run by finishing as runner-up at The 130th Amateur Championship at Royal St. George's in Sandwich, England this past June.

The 19-year-old from Co Louth, Ireland, fell just short of victory in an epic 36-hole final match against American Ethan Fang, losing 1-up after Fang birdied the final hole. Tiernan held a 1-up lead through the first round and never trailed during the opening 18 holes, spending nine holes ahead and seven tied.

What made Tiernan's achievement even more impressive was his path to the final. The ETSU Buccaneer earned his spot in the field through pre-qualifying and played a grueling 175 holes throughout the week. Despite entering the tournament ranked 1,340th in the World Amateur Golf Rankings, Tiernan became the first player to reach the final after coming through stroke play pre-qualifying.

"I was pumped up so I wasn't really feeling the tiredness too much," Tiernan said after the final, acknowledging the physical demands of the tournament.

ETSU head coach Aaron O'Callaghan, a Cork native who has worked with Tiernan since he joined the program in 2024, praised his player's mental fortitude. O'Callaghan highlighted Tiernan's "composure, creativity, and belief" throughout the championship.

The runner-up finish represents a breakthrough moment for Tiernan, who noted significant improvement in his game since joining the Buccaneers. "My game has come on so much since Christmas," he said, crediting his development under O'Callaghan's guidance.

Earlier in the spring, Tiernan had his "breakout moment as a Buccaneer" at the Southern Conference Championship, where ETSU was tied for the lead during the tournament.

As runner-up, Tiernan narrowly missed earning automatic entries to The Open Championship, The Masters, and U.S. Open Championship, which would have been awarded to the tournament winner.

The performance marks one of the highest achievements by an ETSU golfer on the international stage and continues the program's growing reputation under O'Callaghan's leadership.

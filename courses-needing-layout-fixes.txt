TEMPLATE ISSUES TO CHECK:
1. Duplicate weather bar (look for weather bar before navigation.php include)
2. Template structure consistency with TPC Southwind/Bear Trace layout
3. Course info cards (3-column layout)
4. Hero section with stats
5. Signature holes section
6. Photo gallery modal functionality
7. Reviews section integration

HOW TO CHECK FOR WEATHER BAR ISSUE:
1. Look for weather bar HTML around line 552-577
2. Check if "Loading..." text appears in weather bar
3. Verify navigation.php include exists
4. Remove duplicate weather bar, keep only navigation.php include

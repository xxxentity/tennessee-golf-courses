- ✅ Image management: Course images manual upload, news images via Git
- ✅ .gitignore properly configured to ignore course images but allow news images

### Content Created

  - Round 2: "Scheffler Seizes Control with Career-Best 64"
  - Round 3: "Scheffler Extends Lead to Four Shots with Bogey-Free 67"

## Critical Learning: Architecture First
**MISTAKE IDENTIFIED:** Built content features (comments) before backend infrastructure.
**LESSON:** Should build database + user accounts + admin system BEFORE adding user-generated content.

## Next Phase: Backend Infrastructure
User correctly identified need to build "bones first, then content."

### Must Build Before Adding Features:
1. **Database Setup** (MySQL via cPanel Database Wizard)
2. **User Account System** (registration, login, authentication)
3. **Database Architecture:**
   - users table (id, username, email, password_hash, created_at, etc.)
   - user_profiles table (bio, location, handicap, favorite courses)
   - reviews table (user_id, course_id, rating, comment, date)
   - comments table (user_id, article_id, comment, date)
   - courses table (complete course information)
4. **Admin Panel** (user management, content moderation)
5. **Security** (password hashing, input validation, XSS protection)
6. **Email System** (registration confirmation, password reset)

### Technology Decisions Made:
- ✅ **Database:** MySQL (not PostgreSQL - right choice for growth stage)
- ✅ **Backend Language:** PHP (supported by Namecheap hosting)
- ✅ **Database Management:** phpMyAdmin interface
- ✅ **Hosting:** Namecheap with cPanel (has MySQL databases available)

## User's Business Vision
- User account system for golfers
- Course reviews and ratings by verified users
- Comments on news articles (requires login)
- E-commerce integration (golf products, equipment)
- Coach/instructor listings with bookings
- Forum/community features
- Potential for tournament organization

## Immediate Next Steps
1. User to create MySQL database via cPanel Database Wizard
2. Design database schema for user accounts and content
3. Build PHP backend for user registration/authentication
4. Create admin panel for user management
5. Implement proper comment/review system tied to user accounts

## Key Technical Notes
- Git deployment working properly (resolved push/pull issues)
- Images strategy: Large course images manual upload, small news images via Git
- Navigation JavaScript fixed to allow proper page transitions
- Cache busting implemented for JavaScript updates (?v=3)
- Real tournament photography sourced from official PGA Tour images

## User Feedback Patterns
- Values thorough research and accuracy in content
- Wants proper backend architecture before features
- Prefers manual image uploads for large files
- Appreciates detailed explanations and planning
- Focused on building sustainable, scalable system

## Ready to Continue With:
Database setup using cPanel Database Wizard, then building PHP user authentication system.

        <p>PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland — Scottie Scheffler delivered a masterpiece at Royal Portrush on Friday, firing a career-best 7-under 64 in major championship play to seize control of the 153rd Open Championship and position himself for his fourth major title.</p>

        <p>The world No. 1's round was a thing of beauty, with Scheffler making eight birdies in near-perfect conditions that were a stark contrast to Thursday's challenging weather. What made the performance even more remarkable was the quality of his putting—none of his eight birdies came from closer than seven feet, with five rolling in from the 10-foot range or beyond.</p>

        <p>Scheffler's 64 not only established him as the man to beat heading into the weekend but also made history. He became the first world No. 1 to lead The Open Championship at the halfway point since Tiger Woods accomplished the feat in 2006, adding another layer of significance to his commanding position.</p>

        <div class="quote-box">
            "I felt really good with my putting today," Scheffler said after signing his card. "When you're hitting it to 10, 12, 15 feet and making those putts, that's when you shoot really low scores. The conditions were definitely more favorable today, and I was able to take advantage."
        </div>

        <p>Behind Scheffler, England's Matt Fitzpatrick maintained his strong play from the opening round, adding a solid 66 to sit just one shot back at 9-under. Fitzpatrick ignited the back nine with four consecutive birdies, showcasing the type of momentum that could prove dangerous over the weekend.</p>

        <p>Brian Harman emerged as a genuine contender with a bogey-free 64 that matched Scheffler's low round of the day. The 2023 Open champion showed he knows how to handle the pressure of major championship golf, moving to 8-under and just two shots off the lead.</p>

        <p>China's Haotong Li, who shared the first-round lead, remained in contention with a steady 67 to sit at 8-under alongside Harman. Li's consistent play through two rounds has established him as a dark horse candidate for his first major championship.</p>

        <p>While Scheffler soared, some notable names struggled to keep pace. Rory McIlroy, playing in front of adoring home crowds, could only manage a 69 to sit at 3-under, seven shots back and facing an uphill battle. The four-time major winner will need something special over the weekend to get back into contention.</p>

        <p>Bryson DeChambeau provided one of the day's most dramatic storylines, bouncing back from an opening-round 78 with a brilliant 65—a 13-shot improvement that epitomized the wild swings possible at major championships. While his comeback may have come too late for a weekend run, it showcased the American's never-say-die attitude.</p>

        <div class="stat-highlight">
            <h4><i class="fas fa-target"></i> Scheffler's Statistical Dominance</h4>
            <p>Through 36 holes, Scheffler ranks second in the field in putting, gaining more than six strokes on the greens. His combination of ball-striking and putting has created a potent formula for major championship success.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The weather forecast for the weekend suggests more challenging conditions may return, which could play into Scheffler's hands. The 28-year-old American has proven time and again that he thrives when conditions get tough, using his superior course management and mental fortitude to separate himself from the field.</p>

        <p>Friday's second round also saw the cut line fall at 1-over par, with several big names missing the weekend. The brutal nature of Royal Portrush claimed its victims, but for those who survived, the weekend promises to deliver more drama.</p>

        <p>As Scheffler heads into the weekend with his sights set on a fourth major championship, his recent track record provides confidence. He has converted his last nine 54-hole leads into victories, a streak that includes his Masters and PGA Championship wins this year.</p>

        <p>"I've been in this position before," Scheffler said when asked about leading a major championship. "I know what it takes, and I'll just focus on executing one shot at a time. There's still a lot of golf left, and this course can humble you quickly if you're not careful."</p>

        <p>With Royal Portrush set to test the field once again over the weekend, Saturday's third round will be crucial in determining whether Scheffler can maintain his advantage or if one of the challengers can mount a serious charge for the Claret Jug.</p>

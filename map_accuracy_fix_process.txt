MAP ACCURACY FIX PROCESS - SUCCESSFUL METHOD
==================================================

PROBLEM: Golf course coordinates were inaccurate, showing courses "streets away" from actual locations

SOLUTION: ArcGIS World Geocoder (Proven Most Accurate)

WINNING METHOD:
1. Use ArcGIS World Geocoding Service: https://geocode.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer/findAddressCandidates
2. Parameters: SingleLine=address, f=json, countryCode=USA, maxLocations=1
3. Look for confidence scores 80+ (90-100% is ideal)
4. Extract coordinates: [location.x, location.y] format
5. Update 3 places: course page address, Google Maps embed, interactive map coordinates

COURSES FIXED WITH THIS METHOD:
- Southern Hills Golf & Country Club: [-85.599524, 36.104977] (was way off)

        <section class="tournament-overview">
            <h2>Tournament Overview: A Weekend of High Drama</h2>
            <p>From September 26-28, 2025, Bethpage Black Golf Course on Long Island served as the battleground for the 45th Ryder Cup, where Team Europe, led by captain Luke Donald, faced off against Team USA under the guidance of captain Keegan Bradley. What unfolded was a masterclass in competitive golf that saw Europe build a commanding lead before surviving a fierce American comeback attempt.</p>

            <p>The tournament began with Europe establishing early dominance, taking a 5.5-2.5 lead after Friday's opening matches. Saturday's action saw Europe extend their advantage to a historic 11.5-4.5 margin, the largest lead in Ryder Cup history after two days. However, Sunday's singles matches brought one of the greatest comebacks in American golf history, as the home team won 8.5 of 12 available points, falling just short of completing what would have been the most remarkable turnaround in Ryder Cup annals.</p>

            <h2>Day-by-Day Tournament Breakdown</h2>

            <h3>Friday, September 26: Europe's Opening Statement</h3>
            <p>The tournament opened with Europe making an immediate statement in the morning foursomes, winning three of four matches to take a 3-1 lead. The afternoon four-ball session was more evenly contested, with both teams securing 2.5 points each, giving Europe a 5.5-2.5 advantage heading into Saturday.</p>

            <p>Key performances included Tommy Fleetwood's stellar play alongside partner Tyrrell Hatton, establishing the foundation for what would become a perfect tournament for the English golfer. The American duo of Scottie Scheffler and Collin Morikawa struggled in their opening match, setting the tone for a challenging weekend for the world's top-ranked player.</p>

            <h3>Saturday, September 27: Historic European Dominance</h3>
            <p>Saturday witnessed one of the most dominant single-day performances in Ryder Cup history, as Europe swept both the morning foursomes and afternoon four-ball sessions 4-0, extending their lead to an unprecedented 11.5-4.5. This marked the largest two-day lead in Ryder Cup history and left many wondering if the Americans could mount any sort of comeback.</p>

            <p>Tommy Fleetwood continued his perfect play, while Scottie Scheffler's struggles intensified, leading to questions about his form and pairing decisions. The European team displayed remarkable chemistry and confidence, with every pairing contributing to the historic sweep.</p>

            <h3>Sunday, September 28: American Fight and European Resilience</h3>
            <p>The final day of singles competition delivered some of the most compelling golf in Ryder Cup history. Team USA, facing the largest deficit ever entering Sunday play, mounted a furious comeback that saw them win 8.5 of 12 available points. The American team needed to win 9.5 points to retain the cup, and they came tantalizingly close.</p>

            <p>Despite the American surge, Europe's earlier dominance proved sufficient as they secured the half-point needed to claim victory. The final margin of 15-13 reflected both Europe's commanding early play and America's remarkable resilience when facing elimination.</p>

        <section class="individual-performances">
            <h2>Individual Performances and Storylines</h2>

            <h3>Tommy Fleetwood: The Perfect Player</h3>
            <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood emerged as the undisputed star of the 2025 Ryder Cup, becoming only the third player in tournament history to achieve a perfect 5-0-0 record. Fleetwood's consistent excellence across all formats of play proved instrumental in Europe's victory, as he delivered crucial points in both team and individual competition.</p>

            <p>Fleetwood's performance included victories in Friday's foursomes and four-ball, Saturday's historic sweep, and a commanding singles victory on Sunday. His calm demeanor under pressure and clutch putting throughout the weekend exemplified the European team's overall composure and preparation.</p>

            <h3>Scottie Scheffler's Struggles</h3>
            <p>Perhaps the most surprising storyline of the tournament was the poor form displayed by world number one Scottie Scheffler. The American star, who entered the competition as one of the favorites to lead the home team's charge, managed just 1.5 points from four matches, well below expectations for a player of his caliber.</p>

            <p>Scheffler's difficulties included losses in both Friday formats, a benching for Saturday's morning session, and a disappointing performance in Saturday's four-ball. While he managed a singles victory on Sunday, his overall contribution fell far short of what Team USA needed from their top-ranked player.</p>

            <h3>Viktor Hovland's Injury Withdrawal</h3>
            <p>Team Europe faced adversity when Norwegian star Viktor Hovland was forced to withdraw from competition due to injury concerns. The withdrawal required captain Luke Donald to make strategic adjustments to his pairings and rotations, demonstrating the depth and flexibility of the European squad.</p>

            <h3>Ticket Pricing Controversy</h3>

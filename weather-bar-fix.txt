WEATHER BAR FIX - DUPLICATE WEATHER BAR ISSUE
==============================================

PROBLEM:
- Course pages showing "Loading..." in weather bar
- Weather bar not disappearing/reappearing properly on scroll
- Weather bar functionality broken

CAUSE:
- Duplicate weather bars on course pages
- Course file contains its own weather bar AND includes navigation.php (which also has weather bar)
- The duplicate weather bar in course file conflicts with proper navigation.php weather bar

SOLUTION:
Remove the duplicate weather bar section from individual course files.

WHAT TO REMOVE:
Look for this code block in course PHP files (usually around lines 552-577):

    <!-- Weather Bar -->
    <div class="weather-bar">
        <div class="weather-container">
            <div class="weather-info">
                <div class="current-time">
                    <i class="fas fa-clock"></i>
                    <span id="current-time">Loading...</span>
                </div>
                <div class="weather-widget">
                    <i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i>
                    <span id="weather-temp">Perfect Golf Weather</span>
                    <span class="weather-location">Nashville, TN</span>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="golf-conditions">
                <div class="condition-item">
                    <i class="fas fa-wind"></i>
                    <span>Wind: <span id="wind-speed">5 mph</span></span>
                </div>
                <div class="condition-item">
                    <i class="fas fa-eye"></i>
                    <span>Visibility: <span id="visibility">10 mi</span></span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Dynamic Navigation -->

REPLACE WITH:
    <!-- Dynamic Navigation -->

KEEP:
- The navigation.php include: <?php include '../includes/navigation.php'; ?>
- This provides the proper weather bar with correct scroll behavior

COURSES FIXED:

- bear-trace-harrison-bay.php (2025-07-30)

HOW TO IDENTIFY THE ISSUE:
1. Weather bar shows "Loading..." text
2. Weather bar doesn't hide when scrolling down
3. Weather bar doesn't reappear when scrolling back to top
4. Check if course file has duplicate weather bar before navigation.php include

QUICK FIX COMMAND:
Edit the course file and remove the duplicate weather bar section, keeping only the navigation.php include.
